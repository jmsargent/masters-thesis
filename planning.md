# Things to do early

* Succesfully run and gain a base understanding of how to use the multi-gpu framework.

* Comparison of the latencies of performing DVFS on more recent models, is there a trend
towards lower DVFS latencies, or is it stationary? Either perform benchmarks, or find information some other way.

* Comparison between different methods of applying DVFS, map memory into user space? Use synergi API? Is there a considerable difference in the round-trip latencies between different ways of adjusting latency?
